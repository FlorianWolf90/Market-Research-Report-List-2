<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Industrial Humidity Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Relative Humidity Sensor</li><li>Absolute Humidity Sensor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The industrial humidity sensors market comprises two primary types: relative humidity sensors and absolute humidity sensors. Relative humidity sensors measure the amount of moisture in the air relative to its maximum capacity at a given temperature, making them ideal for applications like HVAC and climate control. Absolute humidity sensors, on the other hand, quantify the actual amount of water vapor present in the air, regardless of temperature, and are often used in processes requiring precise humidity control, such as in pharmaceuticals and food production.</p></p>
